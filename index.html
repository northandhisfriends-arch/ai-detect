        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>People are hesitant to visit hospitals due to the high volume of patients who require hospital services.
          It is also not convenient for many people to visit hospitals. This means they cannot receive a professional diagnosis.
          They are either very busy or it would take too much time to go to the hospital, so they simply don’t have the time.
          This leads to neglect of their health, as they are not receiving a trustworthy opinion. This project aims to mitigate the problems
          stated above by utilizing Artificial Intelligence in the form of a website, providing easy access to assist in diagnosing any underlying
          health problems these individuals may not be aware of.
        </p>

        <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
        <p>1. Read and go through the website’s instructions and details</p>
        <p>2. Press the "Start" button</p>
        <p>3. Patients are then required to fill out the information as requested</p>
        <p>4. Check the filled information and press submit</p>
        <p>5. The AI will then analyze the information given</p>
        <p>6. Results will be shown after the AI finishes analyzing</p>

        <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
        <p>1. Provide easier access to diagnosis</p>
        <p>2. Provide an alternative method instead of going to the hospital</p>
        <p>3. Reduce congestion in hospitals</p>
        <p>4. Prevent neglect of health</p>

        <h2 id="how">How it works</h2>
        <p>The AI works by taking the data inputted by the users and analyzing them.
          These data include age, blood pressure, mass after 1 week, mass before 1 week,
          urine per day (mL), water intake per day (mL), risk gender (Male/Female/Both), fatigue (Yes/No),
          edema (Yes/No), confusion (Yes/No), common cold (Yes/No), thirst (Yes/No) + other symptoms</p>
